## **Example Conversation:**

You: "I want to become a mobile developer"
AI: "Great choice! Mobile development offers excellent opportunities. 
     For Flutter specifically, you'll need: 1) Dart programming basics, 
     2) State management (Provider/Riverpod), 3) REST APIs, 4) Firebase, 
     5) UI/UX principles. Start with small projects and build your portfolio!"

You: "How long will it take to learn?"
AI: "With consistent practice, you can learn Flutter basics in 2-3 months. 
     To become job-ready, aim for 6-9 months including building 3-5 portfolio 
     projects. Focus on: learning fundamentals (1 month), building simple apps 
     (2 months), then complex apps with backends (3-4 months)."
